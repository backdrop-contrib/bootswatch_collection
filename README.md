# bootswatch_collection
All available Bootswatch themes, implemented as Bootstrap Lite subthemes

This collection of themes is intended to be an easy way for Backdrop site builders
to make use of the nice collection of free Bootstrap subthemes available from
https://bootswatch.com/.

These themes were already available in the Bootstrap Lite, in the Settings, but
they were a little hard to find.  Bootswatch Collection makes each of the
Bootswatch themes available individually.

Licensing to be determined.
